# PortfolioProjects
Hi! I'm learning SQL and Python.  
Here are some small projects I've done:   

1. [Covid_project](https://github.com/Anna-Roman/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Covid_project.sql)  is Covid 19 Data Exploration with SQL.    
Exploring Covid-19 historical data for 2020 - 2021. Looking at numbers of cases and mortality rate globally and in individual countries.  
   Visualization of results on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid-19project_16998987305370/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).    
   Links to the data: [Covid Deaths](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/CovidDeaths.xlsx), [Covid Vaccinations](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/CovidVaccinations.xlsx).  
     
3. [Data Cleaning in Pandas](https://github.com/Anna-Roman/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Data_Cleaning_in_Pandas.ipynb). Learning to clean data on a small made up dataset with Pandas in Jupyter notebook.  
   In this project I learned how to use Pandas for cleaning data. I have loaded data into the dataframe from excel file, removed duplicates and unnecessary data. I used .strip() to remove whitespace, leading and trailing characters from a string in a column.  I used .replace() to rplace one character with another. I split a column into three columns with .stlit().

4. [Exploratory data analysis with Pandas](https://github.com/Anna-Roman/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_in_Pandas.ipynb). Exploring world population data with Pandas in Jupyter notebook.    
Viewed how many columns  and rows this dataset has, what data types and column names. Looked at min, max and mean values of our data. Checked for Null values. Checked if there is any correlation in the data. Visualising this data.

6. [Nashville Housing](https://github.com/Anna-Roman/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20-%20Data%20Cleaning%20Project) is Data Cleaning Project with SQL in BigQuery Sandbox.  
    Visualization of results on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/nashville_housing/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).  
   Link to the dataset [Nashville Housing](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx).
     
7. [Scraping Data From Wikipedia](https://github.com/Anna-Roman/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Scraping_from_Wiki_and_%20explore.ipynb) and exploring this data in Python (Pandas, BeautifulSoup).
     
8. [BMI Calculator in Python](https://github.com/Anna-Roman/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/bmi.py) - simple program to check your BMI.
     
9. [Case Study](https://github.com/Anna-Roman/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/case_study_in_r.R) - BellaBeat is my first project in R.  
    The full version of this project you can check out on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/annar0man/bellabeat-case-study).
